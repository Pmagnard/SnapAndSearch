Before going to production :
- build signed apk
- build apk in release mode with encryption (SafeGuard ?)


Enhancements :
- use a (new) page without camera preview as main activity
- add menu to toolbar
- add other flavours of JustVisual search (flower, pet, etc...)
- implement Google Vision API
- move to a private VCS (since the code will soon contains private API keys)
- provide access to the logs
- internationalize and provide french alternative to english

Fixes :
- have a proper usage of the JustVisual API key
- center the circle progress bar
- have the URL clickable (open a browser)
- have Bing search back up and running
